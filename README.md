# Tahlia-Bolden-Portfolio

https://andreahergert.github.io/team-6-project a link to my first group project

Title is: Tahlia Bolden Career Portfolio

This is a webpage that showcases the various coding projects that Tahlia Bolden either worked solo as well as group projects to showcase the breadth of works necessary for a Full Stack Developer. This webpage includes information regarding a  resume, works and contact information for the employer. Ther is also an about section so that the employer also has a sense of what Tahlia Bolden does outside just coding.

The HTML and CSS did not have starter code. This page is to show elements of sizing to different reader formats using @media, the page uses flex properties so images line in columns and are not lost in formatting on the page. There is a lot of use of CSS elements for background color, positioning, hoover, shadows on borders and use of anchoring the different elements to the page.
