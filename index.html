        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hailing from Shaker Heights, Ohio I moved to the Seattle area in 2010 and fell in love with the pacific northwest. 
            My passion for wine lead me to earning my advanced sommelier certification from the Court of Master Sommeliers. 
            This has allowed me to not only build beverage programs for some of Seattle's iconic restaurants but also travel the world.
            This is only half my story. Technology from the advent of the internet, the James Web Space Telescope to the entertainment provided
            by gaming consoles/VR has always drawn my attention. Becoming a full stack web developer has allowed me to learn and contribute
            to the ever changing world of technology. When I'm not coding I can be found oil painting and cooking for friends.
